# AI Structural Safety Inspector 🏗️
**Prototype for Hack2Skill 'AI for Good' Hackathon**

## 🌟 The Vision
Structural safety inspections are often slow and expensive. This project democratizes engineering expertise by providing instant, AI-driven safety audits using only a smartphone camera and the power of the Snowflake Data Cloud.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
* **Core Engine:** Snowflake Cortex AI (Llama 3.2 11B Multimodal)
* **Frontend:** Streamlit in Snowflake (SiS)
* **Data Processing:** Snowpark for Python
* **Infrastructure:** AWS (Singapore Region)

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Vision-to-Report:** Analyzes building damage images for structural risk.
* **Safety Scoring:** Provides a 1-10 integrity rating.
* **Automated Logging:** Saves every audit into a centralized Snowflake table for large-scale disaster monitoring.
